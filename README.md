📁 Task 1: Caesar Cipher – Text Encryption/Decryption

🧠 What I Learned
Basics of classical cryptography.

Character manipulation using ASCII values.

Writing modular, user-interactive Python scripts.

🛠️ How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each alphabet in the text by a fixed value. It's one of the oldest encryption methods and is useful for understanding substitution ciphers.

For example, a shift of 2:
A → C, B → D, Z → B

💡 Features
Encrypts and decrypts any English sentence.

Retains spaces, punctuation, and case.

User chooses shift value and mode (Encrypt/Decrypt).

📦 Usage
python caesar_cipher.py
Enter message: Hello World!
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypt or Decrypt? (e/d): e
Result: Khoor Zruog!
