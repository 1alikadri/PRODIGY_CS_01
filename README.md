📁 Task 1: Caesar Cipher – Text Encryption/Decryption

🔧 Description
A simple Python tool that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher, a classic shift-based substitution cipher. Users input a message and a shift value.

📜 How It Works
Each alphabet in the message is shifted by a fixed number (key).

Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.

Supports both encryption and decryption via user input.

🖥️ Sample Output
Enter your message: hello world
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted: khoor zruog
Decrypted: hello world
